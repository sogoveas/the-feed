        <h2> my internet usage</h2>
        In the past, I spent most of my time on the Internet on TikTok. I would scroll for hours, without getting bored (which is highly unusual for me). However, in the past couple of my months I've been searching for jobs, so most of my time is spent on my 'Job Search 2025' spreadsheet. I also love LinkedIn, and I spend a lot of time on there looking at job postings and networking.

        <h2> my glanceback screenshots</h2>
        Most of my screenshots from GlanceBack are me at school or at work, this means I don't look the happiest in them. I look a bit stressed in the majority of them lol. I think this is because I was either in class or working, and I was probably thinking about assignments or work tasks. The only one I look a little happier in is in my one screenshot from this design class with Sophia in it! The GlanceBack's only captured me in work mode, I feel like if it had seen me outside of school and work, I would look a lot less stressed. I feel a lot like the gif below of the cat on a treadmill, just continually working,

        The gif above is also a metaphor for how I feel about the future of the internet. It feels like we are just continually moving forward, but not really going anywhere. The internet is always changing, and it feels like we are just running on a treadmill, trying to keep up with the latest trends and technologies. I feel like I'm constantly learning to try and keep up with the latest technology.

        <h2> reflections on the internet readings</h2>
        Schwulst’s article made me rethink what the Internet truly is. I believe that I have fallen victim to viewing the web as a cloud. Even working with web design and applications in the past, I felt there was an amount of mystery that I never truly tried to look into. I do imagine a cloud, simply because of how many ways data is stored in a place called a cloud. Realistically, I understand that data is stored in large data warehouses in physical machines. However, due to how many discuss data is discussed, it often feels like the data is just up in the air. I think there needs to be more transparent and accessible information regarding the truth of the Internet. As a Data Science major, I have learned a lot about how data and information propagate the internet, and I feel like the most accurate description is to imagine that computers sharing data as the computers speaking to each other. The concept of nodes needs to be more widely spread, as they are integral to understanding how the internet works. All nodes are essentially information that is connected to other nodes which contain information. The idea of nodes always reminds me of the PageRank algorithm, and the way in which all links are given a certain weight, which makes them more or less likely to end up at the top of a search. PageRank underlines how all webpages are inherently connected. I feel like the consensus of what a website is today is rather rigid. I found the metaphor “Website as a thrown rock that’s now falling deep into the ocean” insightful, as it makes websites seem accessible to create, as well as abundant. They are limitless to a certain extent. 
        I found the concept of a ‘handmade web’ introduced in Carpenter’s article to be fascinating, as it is a concept I have not heard before. I feel like post-AI, the creation of ‘handmade web’ has had a downward trend. 
        I would love to create a fully ‘handmade’ version of my portfolio! I also think it would be cool to create a webpage that mimics Cher from Clueless’s online wardrobe. 
        The internet feels quite sterile now, so it would be interesting to see a sort of regression to a more ‘handmade’ and personal web. Schwulst mentions how highly commercialized the internet is nowadays; I feel that this has been worsened with e-commerce and the focus on money. I would love to see more personal and fun websites be promoted in search engines, however, this is unlikely due to the capitalist focus of today’s society.
        Overall, I found both articles to be insightful; they both made me rethink the way in which I approach the internet.

    <h2>touching grass</h2>
    <div class="paragraph-wrapper">
        See me <a href="touchinggrass.html" style="color: #c2297f; font-weight: bold;">touching grass here!</a> I feel much more free when I am outside, whereas I often feel confined when I am on my computer. I think it is important to take breaks from the internet and technology, as constant screen time can be overwhelming. I try to find a balance between being indoors and enjoying the outdoors, even though a lot of my schoolwork is online. 

        I am learning to set boundaries for my online time, prioritizing activities that truly add value to my life while limiting distractions. Finding balance between digital life and real-world experiences has become a personal goal, and I am trying to be more mindful about how I spend my time. I make it a point to go for walks with friends and have picnics when the weather is nice!
